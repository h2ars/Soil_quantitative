# Soil_quantitative
Various models have been applied to predict soil properties from Vis-NIR spectra. Some models have shown good performance with specific properties, and poor performance with others. Some machine learning models that have been used are PLSR, RF, cubist, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS).

Several deep learning models have also been used including artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN).

The different metrics used to evaluate the developed models are coefficient of determination (𝑅𝑅2 ), Relative Percentage Difference (RPD), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Standard Error of Prediction (SEP).
